## Prompt

I have a product photo of a briefcase at `/tmp_workspace/briefcase.png`.

Please design an **informational product display image** (1080×1440 px PNG) for this item. The image should clearly present the product's key features and characteristics in a clean, professional layout.

Basic info:

- **Brand**: Thornfield & Co.
- **Product Name**: The Meridian Briefcase
- **Tagline**: "Carry Your Story"
- **Price**: $279.00 (reference price $379.00)

Look at the product photo carefully, identify its standout features (material, craftsmanship, functionality, etc.), and prominently showcase them in the design. Include a note inviting viewers to learn more.

Save the final image to `/tmp_workspace/results/poster.png`.

If you need image understanding or multimodal generation capabilities, you can call the OpenRouter API (base_url available via the `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` environment variable, API key available via the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable).

## Expected Behavior

The agent should:

1. Examine the product photo to understand the product's visual style and characteristics
2. Identify key selling points from the photo (material, craftsmanship, details, etc.)
3. Design a poster that prominently highlights these features
4. Include basic info (brand, name, tagline, price) and a CTA
5. Save the final PNG image to the specified path

## Grading Criteria

### File & Dimensions

- [ ] `poster.png` file exists and has correct dimensions (1080×1440) — wrong dimensions penalize overall score ×0.5

### LLM-as-Judge (3 dimensions, each 0.0–1.0)

- [ ] **Content Completeness**: Basic info present (brand, name, tagline, price, CTA) and product features identified and displayed
- [ ] **Feature Highlighting**: How well the poster identifies and showcases the product's standout features — does it go beyond the given info and extract real details from the photo?
- [ ] **Design & Impact**: Layout composition, visual hierarchy, premium feel, overall polish and persuasive power
