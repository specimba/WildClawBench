## Prompt

This is a full first-half video of a La Liga match between Real Betis and FC Barcelona, located at `/tmp_workspace/first_half.mp4`.

Based on this video, write a **match report with interleaved text and video clips** (in Markdown format), containing the following sections:

### 1. Overview

Briefly summarize the first-half match progression and the halftime score.

### 2. Key Events

List all key events from the first half (goals, red cards, etc.). Each event should include:

- The video timestamp when it occurred (in "MM:SS" format, referring to the position in the source video file)
- A brief text description (players involved, how the goal was scored, etc.)
- A corresponding **5–10 second** video clip

Save video clips to the `/tmp_workspace/results/clips/` directory, named `event_1.mp4`, `event_2.mp4`, etc., numbered in chronological order. Reference them in the Markdown using relative paths, e.g.: `[Goal video](clips/event_1.mp4)`

### 3. Highlights

List other notable moments (dangerous attacks, key fouls, near-misses, etc.). Each moment only needs a text description — **no video clip required**.

### Output Requirements

- Save the report as `/tmp_workspace/results/report.md`
- Save video clips to the `/tmp_workspace/results/clips/` directory
- Keep each video clip between 5–10 seconds
- Reference video files in the Markdown using relative paths
- Also save a structured event list file at `/tmp_workspace/results/events.json` in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "video_timestamp": "MM:SS",
    "type": str,
    "description": str,
    "clip_file": "event_1.mp4"
  }
]
```

Where `video_timestamp` is the position in the source video in "MM:SS" format (e.g., "17:56"), `type` is the event type (e.g., "goal", "red_card"), and `clip_file` is the corresponding video clip filename.

If you need image/video understanding or multimodal capabilities, you can call the OpenRouter API (base_url available via the `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` environment variable, API key available via the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable).

## Expected Behavior

The agent should:

1. Watch/analyze the first-half video content
2. Identify all key events (goals, red cards, etc.) and their corresponding video timestamps
3. Use ffmpeg or similar tools to extract the corresponding 5–10 second video clips
4. Write a structured Markdown match report with Overview, Key Events, and Highlights sections
5. Embed video clip references in the Key Events section
6. Generate a structured event list `events.json`
7. Save all output files to the specified paths

## Grading Criteria

### Text

- [ ] `report.md` file exists and is non-empty
- [ ] Contains Overview, Key Events, and Highlights sections
- [ ] Key events are complete (5 first-half goals)
- [ ] Video timestamps, players, and descriptions match the actual video content
- [ ] Highlights content is reasonable

### Video

- [ ] `clips/` directory exists and contains video files
- [ ] Each key event has a corresponding video clip
- [ ] Video clip durations are between 5–10 seconds
- [ ] Video content matches the text descriptions
