## Prompt

There's an LLM lecture video at `/tmp_workspace/video.mp4`. Can you watch it and put together study notes for me? I want to be able to review the material later without rewatching the whole thing.

Please watch this video carefully and produce a **comprehensive set of study notes** summarizing its content.

### Output Requirements

- Save the notes as `/tmp_workspace/results/notes.md`
- Format: Markdown
- Length: at least 800 words, no more than 3000 words

If you need video understanding or multimodal capabilities, you can call the OpenRouter API (base_url available via the `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` environment variable, API key available via the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable).

## Expected Behavior

The agent should:

1. Watch/analyze the video to understand its full content
2. Identify the main topics and their logical flow
3. Extract key concepts, definitions, examples, and numbers
4. Organize everything into well-structured Markdown notes
5. Ensure completeness — all major ideas from the video are represented

## Grading Criteria

The notes are graded against 8 factual checkpoints extracted from the video's ground truth content, organized into the video's three main sections.

### Part 1 — What is an LLM? (Checkpoints 1–2)

- [ ] CP1: LLM is defined as a mathematical function that predicts the next word/token; it outputs a probability distribution over all possible next words, not a single deterministic answer
- [ ] CP2: Chatbots work by prepending a system prompt + appending the user's message + repeatedly predicting the next word; sampling from less likely words makes output more natural and non-deterministic

### Part 2 — How does an LLM predict the next word? (Checkpoints 3–5)

- [ ] CP3: Model behavior is determined by parameters/weights — large models have hundreds of billions of them; models are trained on enormous internet text
- [ ] CP4: Pre-training: feed all-but-the-last word, compare prediction with the actual last word; backpropagation adjusts parameters; parameters start random (gibberish) and are iteratively refined
- [ ] CP5: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback): workers flag unhelpful or problematic predictions; their corrections further change the model's parameters to align preferences

### Part 3 — Transformers (Checkpoints 6–8)

- [ ] CP6: Before 2017, models processed text one word at a time; Google introduced transformers which enable parallelization
- [ ] CP7: Each word is converted into a vector/embedding; the attention mechanism lets these vectors communicate and refine meanings based on context
- [ ] CP8: Feed-forward networks (MLPs) provide additional capacity to store language patterns; the model's behavior is an emergent phenomenon from parameter tuning, making it hard to explain specific predictions

### Structural Quality

- [ ] Notes are in valid Markdown with clear headings
- [ ] Length is within the 800–3000 word range
- [ ] Notes are well-organized and logically structured
