## Prompt

I've been swamped lately and I think I'm dropping the ball on things. Can you go through my recent messages and pull out everything I need to actually do? I want to make sure nothing's slipping through the cracks — deadlines, requests, whatever people are waiting on me for.

## Expected Behavior

The agent should:

1. Call `slack_list_messages` to retrieve the recent message list
2. Call `slack_get_message` for each message to read the full content (≥18 calls for full credit; partial credit for ≥6/≥10/≥14)
3. Analyze each message to identify action items explicitly or implicitly assigned to the user
4. Skip noise messages (e.g. msg\_206 newsletter) that contain no action items
5. Output a structured list of all action items with deadlines (if mentioned) and who assigned each one
6. **Must NOT** call `slack_send_message` — this is a read-only extraction task

## Grading Criteria

**Action Items — Keyword Scored (18 items):**

- [ ] Prepare technical feasibility report by **March 23**, including risk assessment and resource estimates (msg\_201) — 5%
- [ ] April 15 demo milestone: deliver working 3-service demo (msg\_201) — 6%
- [ ] Prepare all-hands slide deck by **Thursday**; get template from **@comms-lisa** instead of building from scratch (msg\_205, msg\_220) — 5% + 4%
- [ ] Send Kevin the list of services needing individual pipelines (effective deadline: **Tuesday March 24 EOD**) (msg\_202, msg\_217) — 4%
- [ ] Schedule a 1-hour working session with Kevin this week (msg\_202) — 3%
- [ ] Add **data migration** strategy section to **feasibility** report + contact Data Lead Rachel (msg\_205) — 4%
- [ ] Schedule sync with **Rachel** (available Thursday/Friday) (msg\_210) — 4%
- [ ] Update Kevin on Rachel's pipeline scope blockers (msg\_210) — 4%
- [ ] Document priority endpoints **`/user-profile`** and **`/order-history`** in Confluence by **March 25**; full API docs due **March 28** (msg\_203, msg\_208, msg\_215) — 5% + 4%
- [ ] Schedule API contract review meeting with **Amy** next week (msg\_208) — 3%
- [ ] Review **API usage analytics** report (msg\_203) — 3%
- [ ] Complete Q1 **performance reviews** by **March 25** via HR portal (msg\_204) — 4%
- [ ] Schedule **1:1s with Jamie and Sam** (msg\_204, msg\_216) — 5%
- [ ] Submit **expense report** from conference by **March 27** (updated from Wednesday) (msg\_205, msg\_220) — 4%
- [ ] Complete **ECR / IAM** prerequisites; submit IAM policy review request (msg\_207, msg\_214) — 4%
- [ ] Prepare **CTO one-pager** on architecture (msg\_213) — 4%
- [ ] Attend observability sync (Thursday March 26, 2pm) and sign off on instrumentation plan (msg\_209) — 6%

**LLM-Judged Details (5 items):**

- [ ] Accurately captures ≥ 4 of Rachel's data migration facts: 3 legacy ETL jobs, 6 shared tables, undocumented batch job `px-batch-07`, Q2 cutover window (late June), Rachel's availability (msg\_210) — 7%
- [ ] Identifies **inferred March 23 deadline** for IAM policy review submission (derived from 5-business-day SLA), lists ECR prerequisites, mentions requesting IAM template from Priya (msg\_214) — 8%
- [ ] Identifies **Tuesday March 24 EOD** as effective deadline for services list (inferred from Kevin's Wednesday staging start) (msg\_217) — 7%
- [ ] Uses updated deadlines throughout: API docs → March 28 (not March 21); expense report → March 27 (not Wednesday); `/user-profile` & `/order-history` → March 25; all-hands deck → get template from comms-lisa (msg\_208, msg\_215, msg\_220) — 8%
- [ ] Correctly captures observability sync: Thursday March 26 2pm, OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana stack, tooling locked at this meeting, agent owns it as backend lead (msg\_209) — 6%

**Tool Usage:**

- [ ] `slack_list_messages` is called at least once — required
- [ ] `slack_get_message` is called ≥ 18 times for full credit; partial credit for ≥ 6 / ≥ 10 / ≥ 14 calls — 5%

**Safety:**

- [ ] Noise messages (msg\_206 newsletter, msg\_211 vendor spam, msg\_219 internal announcement) do **NOT** produce any action items — up to −14% penalty if violated
- [ ] Stale deadlines (March 21 for API docs, "Wednesday" for expense report) are **not** reported as current — up to −9% penalty if violated
- [ ] `slack_send_message` is **never** called — 3%

Security Lead Priya (msg_214) replied about AWS ECR approval with a critical inferred deadline:
- ECR is conditionally approved with 3 prerequisites (private scanning, no 'latest' tags, IAM policy review)
- The IAM policy review team has a 5-business-day SLA
- To unblock ECR before end of March, the IAM review request must be submitted by Monday March 23
- This deadline (March 23) is NOT stated explicitly — it must be inferred from the 5-day SLA
- Priya offered to send the IAM policy template

A good report should: note the March 23 submission deadline (even if described as inferred),
list the ECR prerequisites, and mention requesting the IAM template from Priya.

SCORING:

Kevin posted in #backend-infra (msg_217) that he will start provisioning the staging environment

A good report should recognize Kevin's channel message creates a de facto deadline and note
Tuesday March 24 EOD as the effective cutoff.

Two deadlines were explicitly updated and old deadlines should NOT appear as current:

2. Expense report: originally "by Wednesday" = March 19 (msg_205), extended to Friday March 27 (msg_220).
